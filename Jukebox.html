<h2> 

How I felt about it?

</h2>


<p>I really like working on the Jukebox assignment.
   It was rather easy once I hard a clear vision of what I had to do and how I was going to accomplished it.
   to create the jukebox I had to do a number of things such as: making a playlist; finding the songs I wanted;
